# Data Science Portfolio


## 1. Machine Learning - CTR prediction 

In online advertising, click-through rate (CTR) is a very important metric for evaluating ad performance. As a result, click prediction systems are essential and widely used for sponsored search and real-time bidding. 

The project predicts whether a user will click on an ad or not using different classification models and compare them.

## 5. Credit Card Fraud detection

Detect fraudulent transactions, wherein once a cardholder swipes their card for payment, the transaction is classified as fraudulent or authentic based on a set of predefined rules. If it is detected to be fraudulent, then the transaction is declined.

Tech Stack - Python, Kafka, MongoDB, AWS EMR

## 6. NYC Parking tickets Big data Analytics

New York City is a thriving metropolis, and like most other cities of its size, one of the biggest problems faced by its residents is the lack of parking space. The classic combination of a huge number of cars and cramped geography is the exact recipe that leads to a large number of parking tickets.
 
In an attempt to scientifically analyze this phenomenon, the NYC Police Department regularly collects data related to parking tickets. This data is made available by the NYC Open Data portal.

Tech Stack - AWS EMR, Hive, S3

## 7. Recipe Recommendation (Big Data with Spark)

The recommendation engine is a way to increase the website's user engagement. If a user is shown relevant recipes, they are more likely to spend more time on your site reading about recipes. Higher user engagement will likely result in more business opportunities like collaborations, promotions, etc.

The performance of a recommendation engine will significantly impact the revenue your recipe site can generate. 

Tech Stack - EDA & Feature Extraction using Spark, Spark ML, AWS EMR

## 8. CNN Skin Cancer prediction

CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

Tech Stack - TensorFlow, Keras

## 9. Neural Machine Translation (Spanish to English)

Build an attention-based sequence-to-sequence model that can effectively understand the context of Spanish sentences and translate them into clear and coherent English sentences.

Tech Stack - Keras, TensorFlow, sklearn, Encoder-Decoder model, Attention mechanism

## 10. Style Transfer using GAN

One of the complicated tasks in medical imaging is to diagnose MRI(Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Sometimes to interpret the scan, the radiologist needs different variations of the imaging which can drastically enhance the accuracy of diagnosis by providing practitioners with a more comprehensive understanding.

But to have access to different imaging is difficult and expensive. With the help of deep learning, we can use style transfer to generate artificial MRI images of different contrast levels from existing MRI scans. This will help to provide a better diagnosis with the help of an additional image.

CycleGAN is used to translate the style of one MRI image to another, which will help in a better understanding of the scanned image (create T2 weighted images from T1 weighted MRI image and vice-versa).

Tech Stack - Keras, TensorFlow, skimage, U-Net Architecture, CycleGAN
